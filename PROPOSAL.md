## Description and Motivation
In this project, Seth and I want to build a resteraunt program that makes reservations for people with the option of what they woud like to eat, carry out, and delivery.
There isn't too much of a reference other then other resteraunts with some similar programs with their dining features. For example if the program however if provided a 
reservation with what they would like to eat would store it into the system after the order/reservation is confirmed for a set date and time which would allow the staff to 
prepare the food before the people that made the reservation/ordered arrived. Obviously carry out and delivery are self explanatory, but with carry out will remain the same
which lets the person know how long until their food is ready and for delivery we are thinking about writing a program that would know how long it would take to reach
the destination the person ordered the food from. We would also want this program to be used by most restaraunts not just one specific restaraunt. If this program was
to be given out to businesses it could apply to major restaraunt buisnesses or even small town restaraunt buisnesses.

## Prior Art
There are programs out there that obviously have some similarities with our project idea, but from where I have been and seen there are actually not a lot of places that I have
seen/been to that use the reservation/order system or not at all.

## Core User Workflows
The core workflows that our project should run as a whole are being able to make a reservation/order and confirm the order/date/time, a way to let the person who ordered
know when their food will be ready for pickup, and to track the location and estimate time of when their food will arrive for delivery.

## Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals
#### Tuesday: A person should be able to make a reservation/order at a restaraunt the person chooses. Seth is going to start on the process of creating the reservation option for the Customer application. This will include allowing the customer to check the availibility of restaraunts, create reservations, and order their meal for that reservation. Joseph will create the database and what it allows for ("Name", "Party Count", "Date", "Time", "Order") and the restaraunt. Joseph will also create the reservation option for the Restaruant application. This will allow the restaraunt staff to view reservations, change menus, and say if they are available or not.

#### Wednesday: A person should be able to order for carry-out at a restaraunt the person chooses. Seth is going to create the carry-out option for customers. This will allow them to schedule a time to pick up their food that they order. It will also give them an estimate of when it will be ready. Joseph will make the carry-out option for the restaraunt application. This will let the staff view their current carry-out orders.

#### Thursday: A person should be able to order delivery. Seth will create the delivery option for the Customer application. This will allow them to schedule a delivery, order the food, and see a estimate of when it will arrive. Joseph will create the delivery option for the Restaraunt application. This will allow the staff to see their current delivery orders. If we are able to in time, we would also like to create a GUI for our application. This will provide some kind of visual aid instead of working purely through the terminal.

## How will we use the content we covered this unit
We will use databases to store data from the customers and allow the restaraunt staff to view that data. We will make classes out of those tables to interact with and change the data.
